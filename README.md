## Description

The code repository recreates the figures published in the reference above and is structured with the following directories
- `data/` stores raw data for experiment 1
- `subproject_jigo/` stores raw data for experiment 2
- `utility/` stores the shared methods and classes called across code
- `notebooks/` stores the notebooks containing plotting code for figures
- `analysis/` stores all outputs generated by the figure notebooks
- `QuickCSF/` stores the modified quickCSF code used to train qCSF models

## Setup

### Environment

To create a conda environment with the relevant packages, ensure you have conda installed (installation [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)). Then navigate to the root path of the repo and run:

`conda env create -f nmil-p-ml-csf-env-JVis2024.yml`

This will create a conda environment named `ml-csf`. To use the environment:

`conda activate ml-csf`
